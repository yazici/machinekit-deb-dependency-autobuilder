A Makefile and pbuilderrc to automatically build Machinekit package
dependencies for Debian armhf, amd64 and i386

Current list of packages:

- Xenomai 2.6.3 and matching Linux 3.8.13 kernel (RTAI in future)
  - linux-tools 3.8 to match the kernel
- ZeroMQ, czmq, pyzmq, libsodium
- libwebsockets
- jansson

---------------------------
Preparing:

The scripts should be cloned out recursively, since they contain
submodules for each package.

    git clone --recursive \
        https://github.com/zultron/machinekit-deb-dependency-autobuilder.git

The pbuilder, reprepro and quilt packages must be installed, in
addition to the usual kernel development environment.

    apt-get install pbuilder reprepro quilt

---------------------------
Restricting build list:

NOTE: It is advised to trim the build list to save build time, even if
explicitly supplying a <codename>-<arch> target.

If only a subset of codenames or arches is needed, restrict them by
trimming the 'ALL_CODENAMES_ARCHES' variable in the Makefile.

Copy the Config.example.mk to Config.mk and edit it for your needs.

---------------------------
Targets:

Use 'make help' to get a list of targets.

Most simply, just run 'make' to build all packages for all
<codename>-<arch> combos.

To pass in options to dpkg-buildpackage, esp. parallel make to speed
up kernel builds, use e.g.

    make DEBBUILDOPTS=-j16

Resulting packages will be in the `ppa/` directory.

---------------------------
Build flow

The basic flow to build a package is:
- Build a chroot tarball, if needed
- Download sources and packaging
- Set up Debianized source directory
- Optionally configure the source package
  - Optionally in a chroot, with dependent packages installed (kernel)
- Build source packages for each distro
- Add source packages to PPA
- If there's a dependency on another package, update the chroot from the PPA
- Build binary packages for each arch
- Update the PPA with the binary packages

Some packages depend on each other packages; here's a list of all deps:
- xenomai
  - linux
    - linux-tools
- libsodium
  - zeromq4
    - czmq
    - pyzmq
- libwebsockets
- jansson
